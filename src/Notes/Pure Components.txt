Regular Component
does not implement the shouldComponentUpdate method. It always returns true by default

Pure Component
implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow props and state comparison
SC of prevState with currentState \
                                    ---Difference?---> Re-render component
SC of prevProps with currentProps /

Shallow comparison (SC)
Primitive types: a (SC) b return true if a and b have the same value and are of the same type
Complex types: a (SC) b returns true if a and b reference the exact same object


SUMMARY
- We can create a component by extending the PureComponent class
- A PureComponent implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method by performing a shallow comparison on the props and state of the component
- If there is no difference, the component is not re-rendered (performance boost)
- It is a good idea to ensure that all the children components are also pure to avoid unexpected behaviour
- Never mutate the state. Always return a new object that reflects the new state?
