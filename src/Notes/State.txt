props vs. state
props:
- get passed to the component
- function parameters
- immutable
- props -> function components
  this.props -> class components

state:
- state is managed within the component
- variables declared in the function body
- can be changed
- useState Hook -> functional components
  this.state -> class components

**setState()**
- always make use of setState and never modify the state directly
- code has to be executed after the state has been updated ? place that code in the callback function
  which is the second argument to the setState method
- when you have to update state based on the previous state value, pass in a function as an argument
  instead of the regular object
